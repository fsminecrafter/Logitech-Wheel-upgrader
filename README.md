# Logitech-Wheel-upgrader
This is the software for the upgrade of the Logitech gaming wheel formula with vibrations. 
This software is made for Armbian (:

---

This project upgrades an analog steering wheel (potentiometer-based) by using a **Le Potato** SBC as a **USB HID gaming wheel**, providing **high-resolution input** via an **ADS1115 16-bit ADC**.

The Le Potato reads the wheel position over **I²C** and exposes it to a PC as a **USB HID joystick axis** using Linux USB gadget mode.

---

## Hardware Requirements

- Le Potato (AML-S905X-CC)
- ADS1115 16-bit ADC (I²C)
- Potentiometer (steering wheel)
- USB micro-B cable (Le Potato → PC)
- PC with USB host port

---

## Software Requirements

- Armbian (recommended)
- Python 3
- Internet access (for dependency installation)

---

## How It Works

1. The potentiometer is connected to the ADS1115.
2. The ADS1115 is read over I²C.
3. The ADC value is mapped to a single joystick axis (Y axis).
4. The Le Potato presents itself as a **USB HID game controller**.
5. Games see the device as a steering wheel axis.

---

## Pre-Setup Checklist (IMPORTANT)

Before running any scripts, **all steps below must be completed**.

---

## 1. Enable I²C (Required for ADC)

I²C is required to communicate with the ADS1115.

### Enable I²C
```bash
sudo armbian-config
```
Then navigate to System → Hardware → Enable I2C
And reboot after enabling.

Verify after enabling by running `ls /dev/i2c-*`
and the expected output is `/dev/i2c-1`.
Required Kernel Modules

---

#### The following kernel modules must be available:

- dwc2
- libcomposite

Verify:

lsmod | grep -E "dwc2|libcomposite"

#### HID Gadget Device

A USB HID gadget must be configured so this device file exists:

`/dev/hidg0`

Verify:

`ls /dev/hidg0`


⚠️ Important
This project assumes `/dev/hidg0` already exists.
The setup script does not create the USB gadget automatically.

3. User Permissions

Run all scripts as a normal user, not root.

I²C Access
`sudo usermod -aG i2c $USER`


Log out and log back in.

HID Gadget Access (Temporary)
`sudo chmod 666 /dev/hidg0`


For permanent access, use a udev rule.

4. Install & Run Setup Script

The setup script:

- Installs dependencies
- Detects the ADS1115
- Calibrates the wheel
- Saves configuration

Run setup
`python3 setup_wheel_hid.py`


If system-wide pip installation fails:
A virtual environment named joystickenv is created automatically

- Dependencies are installed there

- Runtime scripts will use it automatically

Configuration File Location

`~/.wheel_hid/config.json?`


The config file includes:

- I²C address

- Calibration values (min / max / center)

#### Running the Wheel HID
Automatic mode (recommended)

Uses saved configuration and starts immediately.

`python3 wheel_hid.py --auto`

Manual mode

Allows interactive configuration selection.

`python3 wheel_hid.py`

USB HID Output

- Device appears as a USB game controller

- Single axis: Y axis

- 16-bit resolution

- Smoothed and centered output

- Games will detect this as a steering input.

#### Troubleshooting
`/dev/i2c-1 missing`

I²C not enabled

Re-check armbian-config

Reboot

`/dev/hidg0` missing

USB gadget not configured

dwc2 or libcomposite not loaded

HID gadget setup incomplete

Permission errors

Confirm group membership:

groups


Re-login after usermod

Notes

Only one axis is exposed (ideal for steering wheels)

Force feedback is not implemented

Designed for low latency and high resolution

Safe for continuous operation
